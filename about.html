<p> I'm a simple but tremendously curious person. I decided  to study Physics
just for fun, I really enjoy discovering, knowing and understanding about the only universe I'll
ever life on. I've developed a great taste for Solid State Physics and
Statistical Mechanics, and I enjoy other areas in theoretical physics too.</p>

<p>I learned programming quite early and although I like it very much, I never
found it as fascinating as physics in order to study computer science. Nevertheless
I didn't stop working with computers and I have integrated them to my studies
and research work by developing computer simulations. I'm really glad Internet
offers some much information for free, it just feeds my curiosity and I have been able
to learn a lot by myself. It introduced me to Open Source and Linux, which are now my
working philosophy. </p>

<p> On my artistic side, I do ballroom dancing during my free time. Dancing is the
most amazing combination of Art and Sport I have ever practiced. It looks good from
the outside an it feels good from the inside, it is giving motion to emotion. I love
to travel and thus photography and video are also a hobby of mine, I really like to
capture places, moments, things I
have seen and then be able to share them with others. </p>
