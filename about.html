<p> I'm a simple but tremendously curious person. I decided  to study Physics
just for fun, I really enjoy discovering things about the only universe I'll
ever life on. Since I leaned programing, I have spend a lot of my life in front
of a computer and when internet arrived my curiosity just grew even bigger and I
have learned a lot by myself. I was introduced to Open Source and Linux, which are now my
working philosophy. </p>
<p> On my artistic side, I spend my time practicing dance sport, which is the
most amazing combination of Art and Sport I have practiced.  Photography and
video are also my passion, I really like to capture places, moments, things I
have seen and then be able to share them with others. </p>
