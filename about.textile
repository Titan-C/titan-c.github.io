<section>
I'm a simple but tremendously curious person. I decided  to study Physics just for fun, I really enjoy discovering, knowing and understanding about the only universe I'll ever life on. I've developed a great taste for Solid State Physics and Statistical Mechanics, and I enjoy other areas in theoretical physics too.  

I learned programming quite early and although I like it very much, I never found it as fascinating as physics in order to study computer science. Nevertheless I didn't stop working with computers and I have integrated them to my studies and research work by developing computer simulations. I'm really glad Internet offers some much information for free, it just feeds my curiosity and I have been able to learn a lot by myself. It introduced me to Open Source and Linux, which are now my working philosophy.

On my artistic side, I do ballroom dancing during my free time. Dancing is the most amazing combination of Art and Sport I have ever practiced. It looks good from the outside an it feels good from the inside, it is giving motion to emotion. I love to travel and thus photography and video are also a hobby of mine, I really like to capture places, moments, things I have seen and then be able to share them with others.
