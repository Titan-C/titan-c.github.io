I'm a simple but tremendously curious person. I decided to study
Physics just for fun. I really enjoy discovering, knowing and
understanding about the only universe I'll ever life on. I've
developed a great love for Solid State Physics and Statistical
Mechanics. My main focus has been in phase transitions and I currently
work towards understanding Metal-Insulator transitions[^1].

I learned programming quite early and although I like it very much, I
never found it as fascinating as physics in order to study computer
science. Nevertheless I never stop working with computers and I have
integrated them to my research work by developing computer
simulations.

I have learned all about computers online, but learning requires
seeing how things are done. Free Software encompasses this philosophy
very nicely, where you share your work for others to learn about it
and even better build upon it. You can find about the projects I work
on in my git repository [^2].

On my artistic side, I do ballroom dancing during my free time. Dancing is the
most amazing combination of Art and Sport I have ever practiced. It looks good
from the outside an it feels good from the inside, it is giving motion to
emotion. I love to travel and thus photography and video are also a hobby of
mine, I really like to capture places, moments, things I have seen and then be
able to share them with others.
