\begin{content}{the PhD student position in Photoprocesses
at surfaces of nanostructures}{this position}

Your offered PhD position is very attractive to me because
it is at the interface between physics and materials science,
where I developed my former research work. Also because of it's relevance 
for environmental energy technologies, which are nowadays highly
demanded. I have great experience doing computer simulations and
theoretical work, which will be essential for the development of this
research project, nevertheless my experimental training is low. As indicated
in my CV, I have worked as laboratory assistant in Optics, allowing
me to gain experience working with lasers and LIBS. This is of course
not limiting at all and I am very enthusiastic towards doing experimental
work within your research team.
