\begin{content}{the Erasmus Mundus Master of Science in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology}{your program}

Your offered master program is very attractive to me, because it allows me to continue
my career development in field I'm already familiar with and enjoy. It also presents me
a wide range of research opportunities in areas I'm curious about and willing to explore.
After analyzing your program, I decided to follow the path of studies in nanophysics at
Chalmers because of their focus in Quantum Informatics. It's a subject that has constantly
marveled me and is the future of computing. Chalmers has coordinated various quantum
information projects like SQUBIT, SQUBIT2 and currently SOLID, thus making it a very developed center for quantum computing and the right place for me to boost my career in this field.
I feel very exited about joining your master program, knowing in advance that great and
interesting challenges are up to.

Last but not least, I'm also very motivated by the inter-cultural experience
that the Erasmus Mundus program offers. Because it gives me the opportunity
to visit new places and most importantly to learn about their culture and
language.
