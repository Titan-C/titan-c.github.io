\begin{content}{the open position to work on CMS computing}{this position}
Your offered position is very attractive to me because it offers
the possibility to work on large scale and distributed computing
infrastructure. I have always enjoyed working on computer
simulations, but as well as the study of the computational systems
themselves. I have experience in Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo
methods, but also in Linux systems, different programing and scripting
languages, version control and also in serial optimization and
profiling. I feel very excited to work in this subject, knowing
in advance that great and very interesting challenges are up to.
