  I am writing to apply for #1.
  I am a physics student from the ``Escuela Politécnica Nacional''
  in Quito-Ecuador. Here I completed my undergraduate coursework in
  physics and worked as part of my research project in the
  fields of Materials Science and computational physics. My research
  research experience and commitment to excellence make
  me a strong candidate for #2.

}{I have talked with my personal referees listed in my CV about my
  application and you can contact any of them any time requesting
  letters of recommendation or any further information about myself.
  You can contact me via email or at (+593-9) 9643-9206 and I welcome
  the opportunity of a personal interview. I appreciate
  you taking the time to review my application and I look forward to
  hearing from you. Again, thank you for your consideration.

\newcommand{\thesiswork}{
  During my studies I have developed a great taste for theoretical and
  mathematical physics especially in the areas of condensed matter
  and statistical mechanics. In my research I have linked those areas with
  computational physics. Specifically, I have modeled relaxor
  ferroelectrics using a random interaction Ising like model. Under
  the guidance of Dr. Luis Lascano, I wrote my thesis, entitled
  \textit{Estimation, by computer simulation, of the exchange energy
  dispersion between polar nano-regions in
  $Pb_xBi_4Ti_{3+x}O_{12+3x}; x=\{2,3\}$ relaxor ferroelectrics}.
  Here I developed simulation code using Monte Carlo sampling to numerically
  solve my model and simulate the relaxor ferroelectric behavior.
  Afterwards, simulated data was successfully fitted to experimental
  measurements of the real materials, establishing a correlation between them.
  This was a very enriching experience, not only because of the achieved
  academic results, but for the acquired skills of discipline, autodidacticism,
  responsibility and the ability of working unsupervised.}

\newcommand{\teaching}{
  Beyond my research, I have been fortunate to obtain a wide range
  of teaching experience and time managing skills. As my curriculum
  vitae indicates, my teaching roles have included teachers assistant
  and laboratory assistant. I managed to conclude my research work
  on time and well ahead of my former classmates while performing
  this high demanding assistant jobs.}

\newcommand{\phdmot}{
  Your offered PhD position is very attractive to me because it spans
  over various branches of physics, which I'm already familiar with and enjoy.
  I feel very excited to work as a PhD student in this subject, knowing
  in advance that great and very interesting challenges are up to.}
