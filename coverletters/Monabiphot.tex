\begin{content}{the Erasmus Mundus Master of Science in Molecular Nano- and Biophotonics for telecommunications and biotechnologies}{your program}

Your offered master program is especially atractive to me, because it's focus on
nanotechnology for telecommunication. Quantum information technologies have
always inspired me a great curiosity and I eager to work on that particular
field. Fortunately your Master program provides me the appropriate starting
point for my future development in this area. I'm also convinced that studying
and researching about nanotechnology for telecommunication is very necessary
considering the high impact it's applications will have in our global society,
which nowadays already need to process and transfer huge amounts of data.
Truthfully, I feel very exited about joining your master program, knowing in
advance that great and interesting challenges are up to.

Last but not least, I'm also very motivated by the inter-cultural experience
that the Erasmus Mundus program offers. Because it gives me the opportunity
to visit new places and most importantly to learn about their culture and
language.
