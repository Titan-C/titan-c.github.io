title:  Using a Framework for webdevelopment
categories: webdesign
---

This comes after an old idea that has been buging me in the last years. I
can't do everything myself anymore, there is just no time for such thing.
I'm not a specialist in everything, I chosed a focus long ago physics.
Thus all those webdevelopment things I can't do them on my own anymore. I
have to use framework and templates. This is a general Idea. Just take what
ever is already done and use it to build upon it. When it fails go to its
groundings, but don't redo it's hole simplified structure because it take to
much time and I'm not getting paid for it, nor does my value increase a lot
for knowing how something is done that nobody know but uses more efficently
than me. Yes knowing is good but doing is better. It is actually what gets
paid.

So this time again a web redesing. This time using a Framework, why didn't
I used i before, it is just so simple and makes things work. Well yes I still
have to learn its features, but I don't have to bother anymore about its
inner workings or more amazingily of all the problems it solve it did not
even imagined. Just take the current knowledge and solutions to build upon
them. This is the case of the future web design, building responsive websites.
Curious change, from websites of fixed layouts to completely dynamical in size.

So where came the idea of using a framework. Well it was even there, long
before I even though I couldn't do everything myself. But this time was more
influenced as I saw many websites behaving really well and using this framework
[Bootstrap]. Well, it was also inspired by the previous technologies I presented
in the last post like [SASS] and [Font Awesome]

[Font Awesome]: http://fontawesome.io/
[Bootstrap]: http://getbootstrap.com/
[SASS]: http://sass-lang.com/install
